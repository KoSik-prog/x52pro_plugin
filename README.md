# x52pro_plugin

Saitek X52 PRO plugin for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

Your X52's LEDs will run dynamically with this plugin.

There are two modes:
- if the airplane is equipped with a retractable landing gear -> green labels
- if the airplane is not equipped with a retractable landing gear -> blue labels

You can use the autostart.bat file to run the plugin together with MSFS2020, but you have to edit it beforehand and insert the game path:
- open msfs shortcut
- copy Target
- open autostart.bat file
- paste your target path into a file
- create shortcut with autostart.bat target

Have fun!!!
