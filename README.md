Saitek X52 PRO plugin for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

Your X52's LEDs will run dynamically with this plugin.

There are two modes:
- if the airplane is equipped with a retractable landing gear -> toggle switch 2 represents the landing gear state
- if the airplane is not equipped with a retractable landing gear -> toggle switch represents taxi lights

Have fun!!!
